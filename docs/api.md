# Intercom HTTP API

Base URL default: `http://127.0.0.1:8090`  
Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <device_token>` (Intercom device secret — not an Arbiter `atr_` token).

## `GET /health`

Returns JSON readiness for whisper, kokoro, and Arbiter reachability.

- `200` when whisper + kokoro are ready (Arbiter may still be down).
- `503` if speech binaries/models are missing.

`whisper.detail` / `kokoro.detail` say `server http://127.0.0.1:8092` (or `8091`) when the warm daemons are up.

Each turn prints one stderr line:

```
intercom latency turn=… path=arbiter stt_ms=… conv_ms=… arbiter_ttft_ms=… first_sentence_ms=… kokoro_ms=… kokoro_total_ms=… ttfa_ms=… ttfa_kind=ack|answer|fast first_answer_ms=…
```

`ttfa_ms` is time-to-first-audio on the chunked PCM response. `-1` means that stage did not run.

## `POST /v1/utterance`

Push-to-talk audio in → chunked PCM out.

### Request

| Header | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `Authorization` | yes | `Bearer <device_token>` |
| `X-Device-Id` | yes | Stable device id (session key) |
| `Content-Type` | recommended | `audio/L16; rate=24000; channels=1` |
| `X-Sample-Rate` | no | Overrides rate if Content-Type omitted |

Body: raw mono PCM **s16le** (default 24 kHz).

### Response

`Content-Type: audio/L16; rate=24000; channels=1` (chunked).

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-Turn-Id` | Intercom turn id (use for cancel) |
| `X-Transcript` | STT text |
| `X-Device-Id` | Echo |
| `X-Conversation-Id` | Present when a prior session exists |
| `X-Intercom-Error` | Error detail when present |

Errors before streaming are JSON (`401`, `400`, `502`).

### Example

```bash
curl -N \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dev-device-secret-change-me" \
  -H "X-Device-Id: speaker-1" \
  -H "Content-Type: audio/L16; rate=24000; channels=1" \
  --data-binary @utterance.pcm \
  --output reply.pcm \
  -D headers.txt \
  http://127.0.0.1:8090/v1/utterance
```

## `POST /v1/utterance/text`

Same as utterance but skips STT — for bring-your-own transcript / bridge tests.

```json
{ "text": "what time is it" }
```

Fast-path phrases (`hello` / `good morning` and other greetings, `status`, `what time…`, `echo …`) never call Arbiter. Social turns greet back and invite a follow-up.

## `POST /v1/turns/:turn_id/cancel`

Barge-in: stops TTS and cancels the Arbiter `request_id` when known.

Requires `Authorization` + `X-Device-Id`.

## `GET /v1/devices/:device_id/session`

Debug: `{ device_id, conversation_id, last_turn_id, updated_at }`.

## Arbiter mapping

| Intercom | Arbiter |
|--------|---------|
| First utterance per device | `POST /v1/conversations` (`agent_id` + `agent_def` from config) |
| Each turn | `POST /v1/conversations/:id/messages` + SSE |
| `message` | STT transcript only (no voice-intercom suffix) |
| body | `{ "message", "channel": "voice", "agent_def" }` — `agent_def` includes a fresh local date/time rule each turn |
| Arthur | `mode: "spoken"`, `intent.mode: "off"` |
| Cancel | `POST /v1/requests/:id/cancel` |
| Idempotency-Key | Intercom `turn_id` |

Default agent: **Arthur** (`config/arthur.agent.json`).

Reply PCM can start before the SSE `done` event. Intercom synthesizes each
completed sentence as depth-0 text deltas arrive, and also starts Kokoro after
about seven words (`early_flush_words`) even when the first sentence has no
period yet. Remaining text is flushed after `done`; already-spoken sentences
are not repeated.

Related short sentences received together are synthesized as one phrase so
prosody carries across them. PCM is faded once at the bridge and followed by
punctuation-aware pauses (short after commas, longer after questions). A cached
local ack (`Yes, sir.`, `Right.`, `Of course.`, …) can play after `filler.instant_ack_ms` if
Arbiter has not started answering. A tool call speaks a matching cached ack
after `filler.tool_ack_ms` (default 250 ms) when nothing has been said yet.

## `WS /v1/stream`

Duplex on `ws_listen_port` (default `8093`). HTTP PTT is unchanged.

Handshake: `GET /v1/stream` with `Upgrade: websocket`, `Authorization: Bearer
<device_token>`, and `X-Device-Id` (or `?token=&device_id=`).

| Client | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| binary frames | PCM s16le appended while PTT is held |
| `{"type":"end"}` | Run STT on the buffered PCM and speak the reply |
| `{"type":"text","text":"…"}` | Skip STT |
| `{"type":"cancel"}` | Cancel the current turn if one is active |

| Server | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `{"type":"ready","sample_rate"}` | After upgrade |
| binary frames | Reply PCM |
| `{"type":"turn",…}` | Transcript / turn id after the pipeline returns |
| `{"type":"done","ok","error"}` | Terminal |

STT is still one-shot at `end` (Whisper is not streaming). The gain is sending
mic bytes while the button is down instead of waiting for HTTP to open.

At 24 kHz, Intercom uses Kokoro's chunked raw-PCM endpoint and forwards each
native phoneme batch as soon as it is generated. Older external Kokoro servers,
and configurations requiring resampling, fall back to the complete-WAV
endpoint.

Arthur's delivery is inferred from each spoken phrase. Greetings and courtesies
are slightly warmer and more measured; tool-wait asides are quieter and briefer;
warnings are firmer and leave a little more space. The adjustments are subtle
speed, gain, and pause changes on top of the selected Kokoro voice.

Kokoro output passes through a stateful speech DSP chain before reaching the
device: a 70 Hz high-pass filter, a gentle 2.6 kHz presence lift, envelope
compression, makeup gain, and a minus-one-decibel limiter. All parameters are
under `kokoro.dsp`; set `enabled` to `false` for a bit-exact bypass.
